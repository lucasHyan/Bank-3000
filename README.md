A banking application where you can create and calculate rates for 3 types of accounts, where international accounts are converted from USD to BRL.

In this assessment, I was able to practice object orientation with polymorphism, inheritance and interfaces. In addition, I had to carry out a change request and adapt the program's functionality to receive a text file with information from several customers, carry out the calculations and create a new file with the data for each customer.
